This Power BI report titled "HR Data Analysis" provides a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that presents key insights into an organizationâ€™s human resources data. The report includes two main pages: Home and Action, which can be navigated using custom-designed buttons on the left panel. The Home page offers a high-level overview of employee distribution by gender, job roles, and satisfaction levels, along with key metrics such as total employees, retrenchment numbers, promotion eligibility, and overtime status. The Action page dives deeper into performance-related metrics, including the percentage of high-rated vs. low-rated employees, job satisfaction breakdowns, and potential areas for retrenchment or promotion. The dashboard is built using various Power BI visuals like clustered bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards. It also features button-based page navigation configured through the Action settings under the Format button pane. To enable navigation, each button is configured with an Action type of Page navigation, and its Destination is set to the respective report page. This setup allows users to switch seamlessly between report views for enhanced exploration and decision-making. The report is a useful tool for HR analysts and decision-makers to monitor workforce distribution, identify trends, and support strategic planning.
